## Welcome to HAL
HAL is a program put on by the Tacoma Public Library ment to teach kids and teens how to code. On this website, and in our organization, you will see repos and more added by people in HAL. Feel free to open an Issue to request to join, and add all of your things you'd want us to work on!

Thank you to [Perdyx](https://github.com/Perdyx) for helping make this possible, along with John Hargis.
Please look on [our GitHub Page](https://github.com/IN-HAL), and visit [Perdyx's HAL repo](https://github.com/Perdyx/HAL).


Also, if you have any ideas of what should be put on this page, open an Issue and let us know!
Thanks!
